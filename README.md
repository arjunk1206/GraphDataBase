# Graph Database

In this project, we've designed a distributed graph database system that consists of one primary server, and 2 secondary servers, alongside a load balancer process and a client process that enables the client:
1. To create, modify, delete a graph file using the primary servers.
2. To do a Breadth-First-Search (BFS), and Depth-First-Search (DFS) traversal parallely on a graph using multithreading.
